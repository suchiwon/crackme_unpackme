------------ Duelist's Crackme #2 --------------

Hi there. This is my second crackme, and it will
be much harder than the first one, for newbies,
since this time i will add keyfiles to the mix,
and you'll need some knowledge of the ascii table
to solve it.

I would like to greet tC because i got the idea
for one protection inside this crackme while
cracking a crackme coded by him using Delphi.

Please send me your name/keyfile to my email at
"duelist@beer.com", first 2 people will get the
crackme's source...
