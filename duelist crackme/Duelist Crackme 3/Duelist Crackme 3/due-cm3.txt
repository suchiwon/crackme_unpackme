------------ Duelist's Crackme #3 --------------

Hi there. This is now my third crackme, this time
i will like to greet some folks:

  * Klefz for cracking and making tuts for my
    previous crackmes (nice work dood!)
  * tC for being a good friend and cracking my
    previous crackmes
  * E_Bliss for hosting my crackmes at his page
    (and sometimes cracking them ;)

For the all others: i wish you GOOD luck on this
one, cause i think you will need it. Just one
quick tip that you should remember when cracking
schemes using checkboxes: use a resource editor
to know the ID of each checkbox so you can know
which one is being checked by the program (you
know, they aren't checked in the right order,
sometimes :PP). Anyway i was able to crack this
one (heh) even without first knowing the solution
(and i'm not joking), but it should give you some
trouble, maybe it's better to calculate how many
chances there are... (hummm... square of 18, nice!)

Please send me your screenshot to my email at
"duelist@beer.com", first 3 people will get the
crackme's source...
