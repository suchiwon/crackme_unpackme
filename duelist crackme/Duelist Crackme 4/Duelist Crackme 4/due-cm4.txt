------------ Duelist's Crackme #4 --------------

Hi there. This is now my fourth crackme, let's
see if i make this one easier than the previous.
This time, and from now on, i will define basic
objectives (tasks) which must be achieved in
order to complete the crackme (they may help you
in your task):

  *  Locate the algorithm and related things
     (i.e. tables used inside the algo)
  *  Using a programming language of your
     preference, code a keygen for the algo

I know the objectives are kinda obvious, but i
make crackmes, not for newbies, but i hope them
to learn something with me :) Heh, after about
15minutes of coding an algo i sudently looked at
it and i realized "fuck, no one will be able to
make a kgen for this shit!" because i was using
big tables and the algo was about 50 instructions
long... BORING!

Please send me your keygen to my email at
"duelist@beer.com", first 2 people will get the
crackme's source... (i also accept name/serial,
but the goal is a keygen :P)

I hope you enjoy this one as much as i enjoyed
coding it, and a last advice for medium/expert
crackers: this algo is a VERY simple one. l8r!
