------------ Duelist's Crackme #5 ---------------

Welcome to my Crackme #5, which has the goal to
introduce newbie/medium crackers to the new
generation of patchers that are growing: memory
patchers or loaders.

I really hope someone writes a tuturial on this
one, including the source to the memory patcher,
because that would be great for people learning.

The reason why this one should be cracked using
a memory patcher is because it is packed. It may
be possible to unpack, tho distributing a whole
exe file is not good.

Your goal is to remove nag-message at startup,
and make the status box say 'Registered'. The
first goal is very easy, altho the second one
should give newbies a little time to think about.
